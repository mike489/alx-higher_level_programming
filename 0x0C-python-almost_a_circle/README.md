Python - Almost a circle
Circle
In this project, I encapsulated skills in Python object-oriented programming by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the unittest module to test all functionality for each class.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:

Import
Exceptions
Private attributes
Getter/setter
Class/static methods
Inheritance
File I/O
args/kwargs
JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization
Unittesting
